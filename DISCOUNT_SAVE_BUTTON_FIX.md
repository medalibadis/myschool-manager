# Discount Save Button Loading State Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: When trying to save discount, the button automatically gets stuck in loading state and becomes unclickable.

**Root Cause**: The discount save buttons were using the global `loading` state from the store, which could be set to `true` by other operations (like fetching data, adding payments, etc.). This caused the discount buttons to become disabled and show "Saving..." even when the discount operation itself was complete.

## Fix Applied

### 1. **GroupDiscountManager Component** (`src/components/GroupDiscountManager.tsx`)
- Added local loading states:
  - `isSavingDiscount` - for save discount operations
  - `isClearingDiscount` - for clear discount operations (tracks which group is being cleared)
- Updated `handleSaveDiscount` to use local loading state
- Updated `handleClearDiscount` to use local loading state
- Updated button states to use local loading instead of global loading

### 2. **Payments Page** (`src/app/payments/page.tsx`)
- Added local loading state:
  - `isSavingGroupDiscount` - for group discount save operations
- Updated `handleGroupPayment` to use local loading state
- Updated discount save button to use local loading instead of global loading

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/GroupDiscountManager.tsx` - Added local loading states for discount operations
- `src/app/payments/page.tsx` - Added local loading state for group discount operations

### Key Changes:
1. **Local Loading States**: Each discount operation now has its own loading state
2. **Proper State Management**: Loading states are set to `true` at the start of operations and `false` in `finally` blocks
3. **Button Behavior**: Buttons are only disabled during their specific operations
4. **User Feedback**: Clear indication of which operation is in progress

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Save Discount Test**:
   - Try saving a discount while other operations are running
   - Verify the button doesn't get stuck in loading state
   - Confirm the button becomes clickable after the operation completes

2. **Clear Discount Test**:
   - Try clearing a discount while other operations are running
   - Verify only the specific "Clear" button shows loading state
   - Confirm other buttons remain functional

3. **Multiple Operations Test**:
   - Run multiple operations simultaneously (fetch data, add payments, etc.)
   - Verify discount operations remain independent and functional

## Impact

These fixes ensure:
- ✅ Discount save buttons work independently of other operations
- ✅ Clear visual feedback for each specific operation
- ✅ No more stuck loading states
- ✅ Better user experience with proper state management
- ✅ Operations can run concurrently without interference

## Notes

- The fix maintains all existing functionality
- No changes to the underlying discount logic
- Only improves the UI state management
- Backward compatible with existing data
