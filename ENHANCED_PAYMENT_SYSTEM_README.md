# Enhanced Payment System - Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

The Enhanced Payment System is a comprehensive solution that handles all aspects of student financial management in the MySchool Manager application. It provides automated payment processing, attendance-based adjustments, refund management, debt tracking, and call logging capabilities.

## Core Features

### 1. Student Registration Fee Management
- **Automatic Processing**: When a student is added for the first time, the system automatically handles registration fees
- **Payment Options**: 
  - If marked as paid: Generates receipt and adds to payment history
  - If not paid: Adds $500 to student balance as unpaid
- **Priority System**: Registration fees are always processed first before any group payments

### 2. Group Enrollment & Fees
- **Automatic Fee Addition**: Each time a student joins a group, the group's fee is automatically added to their balance
- **Unpaid List Management**: Shows detailed breakdown of unpaid amounts with group names and remaining balances
- **Fee Calculation**: Group fees are divided equally across the total number of sessions

### 3. Deposits & Payments with Priority Allocation
- **Smart Allocation**: When a student deposits money, the system automatically allocates it to unpaid items by priority:
  1. **Registration Fee** (always first)
  2. **Groups** (oldest first, based on start date)
  3. **Balance Credit** (any remaining amount)
- **Partial Payments**: Handles partial payments gracefully, keeping track of remaining amounts
- **Receipt Generation**: Automatically generates receipts for all payment allocations

### 4. Attendance & Session Price Adjustment
- **Automatic Refunds**: For students with status "justified", "change", or "new":
  - **Fully paid groups**: Refund session price back to balance
  - **Unpaid groups**: Reduce total fee by session price
- **Real-time Updates**: Payment adjustments happen automatically when attendance status changes
- **Audit Trail**: All adjustments are logged with detailed explanations

### 5. Stop Attendance Case
- **Admin Input Required**: When marking a student as "stop", admin must provide a reason
- **Automatic Processing**: All future sessions automatically become "stopped"
- **Status Update**: Student status for that group becomes "inactive"
- **Refund Calculation**: 
  - **Fully paid groups**: Calculate remaining stopped sessions value and refund to balance
  - **Unpaid groups**: Calculate amount only for attended sessions
- **Reason Logging**: Stop reasons are stored for audit purposes

### 6. Refund Management
- **Eligibility Check**: Students appear in refund list if:
  - All groups are inactive
  - Have positive balance (extra money from stopped groups)
- **Refund Details**: Shows student name, stopped groups with refundable amounts, and stop reasons
- **Approval Process**: Admin requests refund â†’ goes to superadmin approval
- **Payment Page Integration**: Approved refunds appear in Payment Page under "Refund Responses"

### 7. Debts Management
- **Debt Detection**: Students appear in debts list if:
  - All groups are inactive
  - Balance is negative (owe money)
- **Debt Details**: Shows student names, unpaid amounts, and group information
- **Payment Processing**: Admin can process debt payments with full payment details
- **Call Log Integration**: Add call log action button for debt collection

### 8. Group Page Sync
- **Payment Status Column**: Last column shows "Paid / Not Paid" status
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically updates when payment system marks group as fully paid
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for payment status

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The system uses the following enhanced database structure:

```sql
-- Core tables
student_groups          -- Many-to-many relationship between students and groups
attendance             -- Detailed attendance tracking with status
stop_reasons          -- Reasons for stopping attendance
refund_requests       -- Refund request management
call_logs             -- Debt collection call logging
unpaid_balances       -- Tracking outstanding amounts

-- Enhanced existing tables
payments              -- Added fields: admin_name, discount, original_amount, payment_type
groups                -- Added fields: price, language, level, category, freeze functionality
students              -- Added fields: default_discount, registration fee tracking
```

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Student

```typescript
// The system automatically handles registration fees
await paymentService.handleStudentRegistration(
  studentId, 
  isRegistrationFeePaid, 
  registrationFeeAmount
);
```

### Processing a Deposit

```typescript
// Automatically allocates to unpaid items by priority
const result = await paymentService.processDeposit(
  studentId,
  amount,
  new Date(),
  'Monthly payment',
  'Admin Name'
);

// Result includes allocation details
console.log('Allocations:', result.allocations);
console.log('Deposit ID:', result.depositId);
```

### Handling Attendance Changes

```typescript
// Automatically adjusts payments for justified absences
await paymentService.handleAttendanceAdjustment(
  studentId,
  groupId,
  sessionId,
  'present', // old status
  'justified' // new status
);
```

### Stopping Student Attendance

```typescript
// Handles all aspects of stopping attendance
await paymentService.handleStopAttendance(
  studentId,
  groupId,
  'Student moved to another city',
  'Admin Name'
);
```

## Integration with Existing Code

### Store Integration

The enhanced payment system integrates with the existing Zustand store:

```typescript
// In src/store/index.ts
import { paymentService } from '../lib/payment-service';

// Enhanced payment methods
getStudentBalance: async (studentId: string) => {
  return await paymentService.getStudentBalance(studentId);
},

processDeposit: async (studentId: string, amount: number, date: Date, notes?: string) => {
  return await paymentService.processDeposit(studentId, amount, date, notes);
},

handleAttendanceAdjustment: async (studentId: string, groupId: number, sessionId: string, oldStatus: string, newStatus: string) => {
  return await paymentService.handleAttendanceAdjustment(studentId, groupId, sessionId, oldStatus, newStatus);
}
```

### Component Integration

The enhanced attendance table can be used in existing group pages:

```typescript
import EnhancedAttendanceTable from '../components/EnhancedAttendanceTable';

// In your group details page
<EnhancedAttendanceTable
  group={group}
  students={students}
  sessions={sessions}
  onAttendanceUpdate={handleAttendanceUpdate}
  onBulkUpdate={handleBulkUpdate}
/>
```
