# Payment System Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Balance Calculation Discrepancy**
**Problem**: Student had 6000 to pay for group, but balance showed 5500 instead of 6000.

**Root Cause**: The `getStudentBalance` function was filtering out payments that didn't have notes, causing some payments to be excluded from the balance calculation.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified payment filtering logic in `src/lib/supabase-service.ts`
- Changed from requiring notes to be present to only excluding payments marked as "automatic", "system", or "default"
- This ensures all legitimate payments are included in balance calculations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/supabase-service.ts` - Lines 2060-2075 and 2220-2225

**Impact on Existing Students**: ✅ **AUTOMATIC** - All existing students will automatically use the corrected balance calculation when their data is loaded. No manual intervention required.

### 2. **Deposit Amount Field Wheel Scroll Issue**
**Problem**: When using mouse wheel to scroll on deposit amount fields, the amount would increase/decrease unexpectedly.

**Root Cause**: The Input component didn't prevent wheel events on number inputs, allowing browser default behavior to change values.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `onWheel` event handler to `src/components/ui/Input.tsx`
- Prevents wheel scrolling from changing number input values
- Maintains existing arrow key prevention

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/Input.tsx` - Added wheel event prevention

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Balance Calculation Test**:
   - Check a student with known payment amounts
   - Verify balance matches expected total
   - Confirm group unpaid amounts are accurate
   - **For existing students**: Refresh the page and check if balances are now correct

2. **Input Field Test**:
   - Try scrolling with mouse wheel on deposit amount fields
   - Verify values don't change unexpectedly
   - Test arrow keys still work as expected

## Impact

These fixes ensure:
- ✅ Accurate balance calculations for all students (including existing ones)
- ✅ Consistent payment tracking across the system
- ✅ Better user experience with input fields
- ✅ No unexpected value changes during normal scrolling
- ✅ **Automatic application to all existing students**

## Notes

- **The balance calculation fix is backward compatible** and doesn't affect existing data
- **All existing students will automatically benefit** from the corrected balance calculation
- **No data migration required** - the fix is applied in real-time when students are viewed
- The input field fix only prevents unwanted behavior while maintaining all intended functionality

## Verification Scripts

Two SQL scripts have been created to verify the fixes:
- `balance-recalculation-verification.sql` - Shows the impact on existing students
- `verify-balance-fix-application.sql` - Confirms the fix will be applied automatically
