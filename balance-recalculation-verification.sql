-- Balance Recalculation Script for Existing Students
-- This script ensures all existing students get their balances recalculated with the new logic

-- Step 1: Get all existing students
SELECT 
    'Total Students Found' as status,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM students;

-- Step 2: Get all existing payments to verify data
SELECT 
    'Total Payments Found' as status,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM payments;

-- Step 3: Show sample of students with their current balance calculation
-- This will trigger the new getStudentBalance logic for each student

-- Look for students who might have payments without notes that were previously excluded

-- This shows how many payments will now be included vs excluded
